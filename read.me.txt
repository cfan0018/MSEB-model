A few notes on how to run the MSEB model, which is the model that is used in Fan and Dommenget (2021)
*Fan, C. S., & Dommenget, D. (2021). A Diagnostic Model for The Large-Scale Tropical Circulation Based on Moist Static Energy Balance.

1) Compling: you need a PYTHON compiler to compile the code. 

2) You might need to install few packages (e.g. geopy, scipy, metpy) before running the code. In order to install package, for example, you can execute with the following command: 
pip install geopy  

3) Input data (e.g. ERA5) download script: era5.py 
Please go to the documentation page (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to) for information as to how to use the CDS API before running this script. 
You can execute the script to compile and download data with the following command: 
python era5.py

4) MSEB model run script: mseb.model.py
You can execute the script to compile and run the model with the following command: 
python mseb.model.py

5) Output from MSEB model is in .nc file format.
